Multimedia System Design - Marks Automation Script        Jan 2024 - May 2024

Built an automation script using Python, that automates 4 manual positions in the matter of seconds.
Python code reads proprietary data from Baselight machines to calculate filesystem locations of frames.
All requests saved to database and can used for data analysis.
Exports are basic CSV files to XLS files with timecode and thumbnail preview uploaded to Frame.IO.
